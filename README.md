# kde5-gif-wallpapers
Add gif wallpapers to KDE-5

1. create /home/username/.local/share/plasma/wallpapers/org.kde.gif (or change gif to the name you'd like to use)
2. clone there
3. edit contents/ui/main.qml, change /home/kurumbus/Videos/wp/wp.gif to your source file
4. Right click on desktop, choose configure desktop -> wallpaper -> wallpaper type and choose 'gif' or the name you used.

If you want to change the name you should also edit metadata.desktop file and substitute 'gif' with the name you chose.

P.S. I like everyone else wanted to try it, but then I realised it was kind of resource-intensive.
